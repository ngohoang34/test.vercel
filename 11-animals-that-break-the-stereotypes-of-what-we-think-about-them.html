					<h2>The animal kingdom is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;tales and stories. And each creature holds facts and myths that can sometimes be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;look past. We&nbsp;always assume owls are wise and that dolphins are happy animals who enjoy entertaining humans. All these stereotypes are based on&nbsp;ancient cultures, kids’ stories, or&nbsp;cartoons, but many of&nbsp;them have no&nbsp;basis in&nbsp;truth.<br>
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;know more about these wildly wrong animal stereotypes. This list promises to&nbsp;make your jaw drop. Are you ready for some surprises?</h2>
<p>1. Most crocodiles are harmless.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67119 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="838" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-261x300.jpeg 261w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>As&nbsp;strange as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might sound, most crocodiles species are not really&nbsp;harmful. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fact, they prefer to&nbsp;stay away from humans instead of&nbsp;confronting them. The species&nbsp;known&nbsp;for preying on&nbsp;humans are the Nile crocodile and saltwater crocodile, so&nbsp;these 2&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;avoided at&nbsp;all costs. They can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.<br>
2. Ants aren’t hardworking.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67120 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="560" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-300x231.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>The image of&nbsp;the hardworking ant has persisted for centuries due to&nbsp;the fables and short stories we’ve been hearing since we&nbsp;were kids. But this popular belief needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reconsidered because not all ants are hardworking, according to&nbsp;researchers. They&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;a&nbsp;high level of&nbsp;inactivity in&nbsp;some ants and declared that almost half of&nbsp;the time, ants were found to&nbsp;be&nbsp;inactive.</p>
<p>3. Pigs are clean.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67121 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="486" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>Pigs have a&nbsp;reputation for being dirty animals, but they’re really quite clean.&nbsp;Actually, they are some of&nbsp;the cleanest animals on&nbsp;the farm. Rolling around in&nbsp;the mud gives them a&nbsp;filthy appearance, but they do&nbsp;that because they’re unable to&nbsp;sweat, and the mud helps them to&nbsp;cool off. Also, they never release their poop or&nbsp;pee near their sleeping or&nbsp;eating areas.</p>
<p>4. Spiders are peaceful.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67122 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="564" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-300x232.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>According to&nbsp;experts, you really have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;some work to&nbsp;get bitten by&nbsp;a&nbsp;spider because they don’t want to&nbsp;bite you. Generally, spiders are peaceful creatures and do&nbsp;not attack humans, they only bite when they are surprised or&nbsp;disturbed. In&nbsp;fact, spiders prey on&nbsp;insects instead of&nbsp;humans, and most of&nbsp;them can’t pierce human flesh.</p>
<p>5. Dolphins are dangerous.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67123 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="819" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5-267x300.jpeg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>Swimming with dolphins always seems like a&nbsp;good idea, and with the smiles on&nbsp;their faces and the lovely interactions they have with humans, we&nbsp;might be&nbsp;tempted to&nbsp;have the experience. But the&nbsp;truth&nbsp;is, the smiling face is&nbsp;simply an&nbsp;anatomical anomaly, and they are wild animals that can be&nbsp;very aggressive to&nbsp;people, other dolphins, and can even harm themselves.</p>
<p>6. Elephants are runners.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67124 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="856" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6-255x300.jpeg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>Elephants are fairly good&nbsp;runners, given their hefty weight and size. Even though they weigh in&nbsp;at&nbsp;anywhere from 6,000&nbsp;lb to&nbsp;as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;15,000&nbsp;lb, they can run at&nbsp;speeds of&nbsp;more than 10&nbsp;mph, which is&nbsp;very notable for these giant creatures. Researchers have claimed that elephants use a&nbsp;biomechanical technique to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this because they always need to&nbsp;keep one foot on&nbsp;the ground to&nbsp;balance their bodies.</p>
<p>7. Owls are not wise.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67125 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/7.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="586" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/7.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/7-300x241.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>Owls are usually associated with wisdom, but little did we&nbsp;know&nbsp;that owls aren’t any smarter than other birds. In&nbsp;fact,&nbsp;studies&nbsp;have been conducted to&nbsp;ascertain this myth. It&nbsp;turns out that the owls’ specialties and biggest strengths are hunting, camouflaging plumage, super-sensitive hearing, and unique eyes that help them to&nbsp;catch prey.</p>
<p>8. Sloths are not lazy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67126 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="483" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8-310x205.jpeg 310w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>You’ve probably been called a&nbsp;sloth for being so&nbsp;lazy from time to&nbsp;time, but that statement is&nbsp;not entirely correct.&nbsp;Sloths&nbsp;may be&nbsp;the slowest mammals in&nbsp;the world, but that doesn’t automatically mean they’re lazy. They have little energy, so&nbsp;they must adapt to&nbsp;it. They eat, sleep, and move only when necessary and at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain speed because their basic metabolism is&nbsp;set at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very low level.</p>
<p>9. Cows are intelligent.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67127 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="533" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9-300x220.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;intelligence, cows don’t score the highest points, or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least that’s what we&nbsp;thought. It&nbsp;has been&nbsp;declared, by&nbsp;researchers, that cows possess advanced cognitive abilities and emotional capacity. They develop friendships, mourn losses and separation, and show love to&nbsp;each other and figure out problems while enjoying intellectual challenges.</p>
<p>10. Snakes are attentive.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67128 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="397" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/10-300x164.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>Snakes don’t have ears, but they’re capable of&nbsp;sensing sounds. That is&nbsp;because vibrations traveling through the ground, such as&nbsp;the footsteps of&nbsp;predators or&nbsp;prey, cause vibrations in&nbsp;a&nbsp;snake’s jawbone, relaying a&nbsp;signal to&nbsp;the brain via that inner ear. The studies have&nbsp;shown&nbsp;that they are very attentive and can sense things through their inner ears.</p>
<p>11. Slow lorises are deadly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67129 tie-appear" src="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11.jpeg" alt="" width="728" height="575" srcset="https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11.jpeg 728w, https://theinfotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11-300x237.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px"></p>
<p>Slow lorises&nbsp;come from the Lorisidae family, and they are found in&nbsp;Southeast Asia and bordering areas. Despite their cute and adorable looks, they can deliver a&nbsp;bite with toxins strong enough to&nbsp;cause the victim’s flesh to&nbsp;swell and rot away. They can be&nbsp;deadly&nbsp;to&nbsp;humans, and getting near them is&nbsp;a&nbsp;terrible idea.<br>
Which animal on&nbsp;this list surprised you the most? We’d love to&nbsp;hear about it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the comments!</p>
